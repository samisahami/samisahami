## Hi there 👋

I build end-to-end analytics systems — from raw data to stakeholder-ready insights — with a strong focus on data reliability, business logic, and decision-making.

### What I do
- Build **SQL- and Python-driven pipelines** for business and Web3 use cases  
- Design **Power BI dashboards** focused on decisions, not vanity metrics  
- Apply **analytics engineering principles** (modeling, transformations, metrics layers)  
- Translate messy, real-world data into **clear insights for non-technical stakeholders**

👉 See my work in the **Portfolio** button above.
