👋 I turn messy data into million-dollar decisions.

Data Analyst & Analytics Engineer specializing in healthcare and Web3 analytics. 
I build end-to-end systems that executives actually trust and use.

### What I do
- Build **SQL- and Python-driven pipelines** for business and Web3 use cases  
- Design **Power BI dashboards** focused on decisions, not vanity metrics  
- Apply **analytics engineering principles** (modeling, transformations, metrics layers)  
- Translate messy, real-world data into **clean insights for non-technical stakeholders**
